## üìñ What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is a virtual machine developed in the 1970s, originally used to play simple video games on microcomputers like the COSMAC VIP.  
It provides a minimal instruction set, making it a great starting point for learning about emulation.

Some popular CHIP-8 games include:
- Pong
- Space Invaders
- Tetris
- Snake
