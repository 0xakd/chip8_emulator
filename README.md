# CHIP-8 Emulator

A simple **CHIP-8 emulator** written in C with **SDL2** for graphics, input, and audio.  
This project was built as a learning exercise in low-level emulation, graphics, and system architecture.

## 📖 What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is a virtual machine developed in the 1970s, originally used to play simple video games on microcomputers like the COSMAC VIP.  
It provides a minimal instruction set, making it a great starting point for learning about emulation.

Some popular CHIP-8 games include:
- Pong
- Space Invaders
- Tetris
- Snake

## ✨ Features

- Full CHIP-8 instruction set support
- Keyboard input mapped to hex-based keypad
- Graphics rendering via SDL2 (64×32 monochrome display)
- Configurable emulation speed
- Sound buzzer support

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
- **SDL2 development libraries**

---

## Build & Run

### build
```bash
mingw32-make clean
mingw32-make

```
### run
```bash 
./bin/main.exe ./bin/INVADERS 
```
